## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the importance of mobile first! I didn't realize what a big difference it makes. I usually do desktop first and then figure out how to make it responsive, but with this challenge, the only way I could get the rounded borders correctly displayed on both mobile and desktop was following a mobile first approach.

### Continued development

I definitely need more practice with mobile first. I also want to figure out how to correctly display the heights of the cards within a container. There are a few pixels where the height is different for the different cards.

### Useful resources

- [Fernando Fe N's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktqHLWab1-0) - This helped me understand mobile first and why my border radius properties didn't update as I expected. Changing around the order of my code fixed it thanks to Fernando!
